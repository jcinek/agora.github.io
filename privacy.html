                <h3>What Data Is Collected?</h3>
                <p>
                    This Website only collects what data is necessary to ensure the functionality of the website. Specifically, this includes all website user's 
                    created chat messages, which once sent by a user are stored in a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> database. 
                    These chat messages include any message sent by a user on any of this website&apos;s included chat rooms. 
                    In addition to chat messages, the only other form of user data stored is a website user's Username, which due to the nature of the site
                    is typically created by a site admin.
                    
                    This website is not designed to, nor does it knowingly or intend collect any other form of data than the aforementioned and described user chat messages, and Usernames. 
                    Furthermore, this website does not knowingly or intend to collect, use, or disclose any form of Personally Identifiable Information. If you believe that 
                    this site has collected, used or disclosed such Personal Data, or any other form of data than the aforementioned and described chat messages and Usernames, 
                    please reach out by visiting the Contact page, or by clicking this <a href="contact.html">link</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>How Is My Data Collected?</h3>
                <p>
                    When a user sends a message in one of this website's chat rooms, it is collected via an HTML form, and sent to a 
                    <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> database using a JavaScript script file. In regards to Usernames, a Usernames are 
                    typically created by a site admin, as this site does not include the functionality for users to create their own profiles. When a user is invited to
                    become a member of this site &#40;meaning that a Username has been created by a site admin for user, thus giving them access to the website's chat rooms&#41;,
                    users are to understand and agree to their Username being created and stored manually by a site admin. At present, these Usernames are then stored in a simple JavaScript
                    array. If you are a site member, and you believe your Username has either been compromised, or you would like to change it, please reach out by visiting the Contact page, 
                    or by clicking this <a href="contact.html">link</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Why Is This Data Collected?</h3>
                <p>
                    Users' chat messages and Usernames are only collected by this site to ensure the intended functionality of this website. In order for a &quot;live chat&quot;
                    to be maintained &#40;meaning a chat room where user's messages are sent and displayed in real time&#41;, users' messages must be stored in a database. Once 
                    a user sends a message, the message is stored in a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> database, and is then displayed on
                    the website's relevant chat room page &#40;via the use of a JavaScript script file&#41; for other users to view. In regards to Usernames, Usernames are stored in order
                    to ensure that members are able to access chat rooms. As the nature of this site's chat rooms are invite-only, Usernames must be entered in order to access
                    the chat room section of the website, meaning therefore that a Username effectively serves as a pass-code to the chat room section of this website. 
                    Because of this, each user's Username must be stored in order to maintain this functionality.
                </p>
                <h3>How Is My Data Used and Stored?</h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned, chat room messages are stored in a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> database. Though the intent of this Website is such that
                    these messages will never be used or sold for any advertising purposes, monetary gain, and or any otherwise undisclosed, illegal, and or other nefarious purposes by the 
                    Website or by a site admin, it should be noted that site admins can access, read, moderate, delete, and manipulate these stored messages. The ability for a site admin to 
                    access these messages is in the inherent nature of the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> database used by this site, and is further intended
                    to be this way in order to ensure that chat room moderation can be carried out should such action be considered necessary &#40;see <a href="tos.html">Terms of Service</a>&#41;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regarding Usernames, Usernames are at present stored in a simple JavaScript array. Users must understand that this website, in its current state, is a work in progress.
                    Currently, the website does not have the proper infrastructure to host user profiles, with Usernames and Passwords, in a separate, secure database. By using this site,
                    and furthermore should a user become a member of this site by invitation and have a Username created for them, they agree to and understand the fact that their Username is
                    stored in a JavaScript array, and that anyone &#40;including and particularly non members of this website&#41; with ample website knowledge or marginal web 
                    development skills can seek for and locate this information. Though this should not be an extreme concern to users of this site, as this site does not store or collect
                    and financial and or other Personally Identifiable Information, the intent of this website is to be completely open about this fact, and ensure that its users are well
                    aware of this as well. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that when asking for a Username to be created by a site admin, that users do NOT have their Usernames made to
                    reveal any Personally Identifiable Information, or any such information about them or related to them that they do not want others to know or use. Furthermore,
                    even if future versions of this site make it such to where a Username is more securely stored, it is still strongly advised that users OMIT any kind of information that
                    they do not want to be publicly known from being included in their username.

                    If you believe that your chat messages, Username, or any other information or data is being used in any way that is not disclosed by this section of this website's Privacy
                    Policy, or in any such way that goes against what has been detailed in how this site uses your data, please reach out by visiting the Contact page, or by clicking this 
                    <a href="contact.html">link</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Regarding Data Collection of Minors</h3>
                <p>
                    This Website is not intended for children or persons under 18 years of age &#40;or the age of majority in your jurisdiction&#41;. 
                    This website does not knowingly collect, use, or disclose Personal Data from children under 18. If you believe that this site has 
                    collected, used or disclosed Personal Data of a person or child under the age of 18 &#40;or the age of majority in your
